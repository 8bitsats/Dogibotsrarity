Define the traits: We need to categorize each trait (e.g., Background, Type, Bot, Rainbow, Coin, Face, etc.) and list all possible values for each trait along with their occurrence rates or rarities.

Calculate rarity scores: We will compute rarity scores for each NFT based on the traits it possesses. There are several methods to calculate rarity scores. A common approach is to use the inverse of the trait occurrence rate. The rarer the trait, the higher its contribution to the overall rarity score.

Rank NFTs based on rarity: After calculating rarity scores for all NFTs, we will rank them from the most rare to the least rare.

Output the results: Finally, we'll provide a way to output the rarity rankings, either by printing them to the console or writing them to a file.
